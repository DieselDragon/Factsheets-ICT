== ICT factsheets for new computer/internet users ==
Originally for use by new users at a Hampshire ICT mentoring programme, but offered to anybody who needs/wants them under CC-NC-SA 3.0 licencing.

Fuller description/intro TBA; This is just a placeholder for the moment.

Will be progressed over time, mainly on days when the weather's bad so I'm more likely to pick up my laptop than my compass. Please remember though; For me, Orienteering comes first! [/] <3 ^_^
